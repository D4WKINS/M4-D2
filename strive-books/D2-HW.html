    <h2>Create your first React App!</h2>

    <h4>
      In this exercise you are going to create your own book store by using
      React Components!
    </h4>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Install and use the create-react-app boilerplate to create your new
        react application
      </li>
      <li>Install and set up bootstrap + react-bootstrap in your app</li>
      <li>
        Create a MyNav component which will render a bootstrap navigation bar
        with the following links: Home, About and Browse. Note: we don't know
        how to perform navigation yet, so for now just put "#" as the href for
        each one on them
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a MyFooter component which will render a footer for the page
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a Welcome component with a Jumbotron and a subtitle for your shop
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a Latest Release component. This component should read from one
        of the json files and print out the cover of the books
      </li>
      <li>Push everything on GitHub and publish on Eduflow before 17:00 CET</li>
    </ol>
